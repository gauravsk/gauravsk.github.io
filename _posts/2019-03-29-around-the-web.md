#### Listening  

- [Rahul Sharma on the Santoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTmACn6dkNE). I heard Rahul Sharma in concert with Zakir Hussain a while back at Royce Hall, and my love for both is strong as ever.  

#### Eye Candy

I had a great trip to the [Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=627) this weekend with Marcel, Alex, and Annie. Some photos from the trip...
