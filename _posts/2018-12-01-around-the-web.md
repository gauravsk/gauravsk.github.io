> An angel whose muscles developed no more power weight for weight than those of an eagle or a pigeon would require a breast projecting forabout four feet to house the muscles engaged in working its wings, while to economize in weight, its legs would have to be reduced to mere stilts. Actually a large bird such as an eagle or kite does keep in the air mainly by moving its wings. It is generally to be seen soaring, that is to say balanced on a rising column of air.
