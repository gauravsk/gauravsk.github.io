#### Ingredients
1. Dried chickpeas
2. Onion, ginger, garlic

#### Steps
1. Soak chickpeas overnight in salted water (not too much salt -- 1 tsp/cup ish)
2. The next morning, drain the water, and pressure cook the chickpeas (1:1 water:chickpeas)
3. In a separate pan, make a phodni
4. Sautee finely chopped onion+ginger+garlic (use the prestige chopper) till there is no "rawness" to the veggies.
5. Toss in finely chopped tomato (use the prestige chopper)
6. Add salt, a pinch of sugar, and Chole Masala (again, should be over-salty)
7. Add the cooked chickpeas.
