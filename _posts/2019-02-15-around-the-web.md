> Ecological patterns, about which we construct theories, are only interest-ing if they are repeated. They may be repeated in space or time, and they may be repeated from species to species. A pattern which has all of these kinds of repetition is of special interest because of its generality, and yet these very general events are only seen by ecologists with rather blurred vision. The very sharp- sighted always find discrepancies and are able to say that there is no generality, only a spectrum of special cases.
