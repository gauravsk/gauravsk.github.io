#### Other research and teaching projects
During my PhD at UCLA, I've also had the pleasure of collaborating on various research and teaching projects. I worked with [Dr. Emily Curd](), [Zack Gold](), and other members of the [California environmental DNA program]() to develop an [bioinformatics pipeline]() to help automate the process of assigning taxonomy to sequences in eDNA projects. I also led the development of a [`R` package/`shiny` app]() to help visualize results from environmental DNA sequencing studies which has been used by various undergraduate microbiology and eDNA classes at UCLA.
