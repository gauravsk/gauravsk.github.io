title: Native American territory acknowledgements in ecology talks #ESA2019
---

It's fair to speculate that almost all North American ecology research is conducted on traditional lands of Native American groups, and it's high time we acknowledge and confront this legacy. One way to start doing this is to integrate Land acknowledgements into our research presentations. 

[Land acknowledgements]() recognize and respect the Indigenous communities as the traditional stewards of the land on which we (researchers at Western universities) occupy and study. These land acknowledgements honor the Indigenous community and [their deep relationship with their land](), and also serve as reminders of our colonial history.
