title: Fall quarter wrap-up
---

Joshua Schimel begins his excellent book [Writing Science](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/writing-science-9780199760244?cc=us&lang=en&) as follows:

This Fall, I began to appreciate what Schimel means. 

On the morning of September 14th -- the day before the Fall quarter began -- I submitted one of my disseration chapters for peer-review (this manuscript is not yet available for sharing). Later that day, I submitted my first independent peer-review of a manuscript. Over the rest of the quarter, I submitted one more peer-review, two more papers ([1](https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1734/v1), [2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/12/07/488627)), a grant proposal, and re-submitted a revised version of the dissertation chapter. That adds up to >25,000 words,  counting only the text that eventually made it to the final version of each of these documents. This list doesn't include the multiple rounds of  comments I gave three friends on their own projects, the presentations I developed for our [departmental Hacky Hours](https://ucla-hacky-hours.github.io/), any of the R code I wrote, or the work I did as a consultant at [UCLA's graduate writing center](https://gwc.gsrc.ucla.edu/).

#### Looking ahead to 2019

I am excited for the challenges that will come with the new year. My main professional goal will be to analyze, write, and submit for peer-review at least one, and hopefully two more of my dissertation chapters. I also hope to continue growing as a person- I will certainly continue being an active citizen of my EEB community on campus, but I will also work to increase my influence by becoming a more active citizen of Los Angeles or of the global scientific community.
