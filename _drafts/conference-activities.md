title: What happens at #ESA2019
---

Many people in my family don't have a great sense of what I do when I travel for conferences. So here's a quick rundown of how I spent my time over the last week. I'll just jot down what I did on the first 4 days of my trip; the remaining three days were just a variation on those themes. 

Warning: far too much detail included here. Continue at your own peril.

### Saturday, 10 August
**4am**: Wake up for a 6am flight from Los Angeles to Louisville, via a layover in Dallas. For lunch I ate some pizza that I had made the night before.   
**4pm**: Arrive in Louisville, get to AirBnB, quick trip to nearby grocery store to stock up on breakfast supplies for five people for a week.  
**7pm**: Another UCLA colleague arrived to stay with us at the AirBnB, went out for dinner + walk around the neighborhood.  

### Sunday, 11 August
I made a mistake today. I had registered for a workshop that I thought ran from 8am-Noon, but it turns out it actually ran from Noon-5pm. 

**6:30am**: Wake up, have breakfast (coffee, cereal, yogurt, nuts, banana). Another colleague from UCLA arrived to stay with us at the AirBnB. Travel to conference center (we took a Lyft this time).  
**7:45am**: Register at the conference (pick up lanyard+name tag, etc.) and head to what I think is the "4 Dimensional Ecology Education" (4DEE) workshop I registered for. Quickly realized that I was in the wrong place (it was a workshop on "doing science with natural resource managers"), but decided to just hang out in the room -- sounded like useful information.   
**8am-noon**: Sit through the Science w/ natural resource managers workshop. Learned a lot about how to most effectively do science in national parks -- what they prioritize, whom to contact, how to get money to do it (answer for all of these: depends on the park! find out who the local science director (or equivalent) is before proceeding to make plans). This seems to line up with what I have observed of my friend Zack Gold working with the Channel Islands National Park.  
**Noon-4pm**: Sit through the "[4 Dimensional Ecology Education](https://www.esa.org/4DEE/)" workshop. I thought this is definitely a  helpful framework that I can use to organize the main themes of my lessons, courses, etc., but it isn't mindblowing -- I think that with a few hours and a mandate to come up with an organizing principle for ecology education, this is what I would arrive at. That said I'm excited to see where the oraganizers take this ball they have got rolling.   
At this workshop I fortuitously met a prof who I had meant to email before the conference. I had some questions for this prof about an old paper of hers, so I introduced myself and asked if we could meet some time during the week.  
**4pm**: Walk back to AirBnB to get some fresh air and to begin cooking dinner, as I had promised my housemates I would do. The walk took about 40 minutes, and I was comprehensively sweaty by the end of it. But our AirBnB apartment was nice and cool, so it felt good to take my mind off of things and cut up some veggies for a while.  
**6pm**: Walk back to the conference center (luckily I took a more shaded path this time) for dinner with the [SEEDS](https://esa.org/seeds/) program, for which I volunteered as a student mentor. Met my mentee, spoke about plans for the week, learned about her background, ambitions, etc. Also met other great students and their mentors at the dinner.    
**8pm**(ish): Went back to the AirBnB. I was tired (and knew I had to walk back to the center before 7am the next day), so took a lyft. Fell asleep probably around 10.30. 

### Monday, 12 August  

**6am**: Wake up, get ready, and head out of the house by 6.15 AM to walk over to the conference center by 7.  
**7am**: Breakfast with the SEEDS crew.  
**8am**: Scientific plenary talk by [Dr. Katherine Suding](), who was awarded the Society's [Macarthur Prize]() last year. It was a really good talk, with great visuals summarizing lots of research from across Dr. Suding's career. The full video of this talk is [available online](). 
**10am**: Went to a special session organized by the [Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative]() to learn a bit about programs that aim to get an understanding of what kinds of organisms live in urban, agricultural, and "wild" soils across the world.  
**Noon**: Lunch with a friend from UCLA in an Ethiopean restaurant. While waiting for food I met a good friend, so caught up with him over food.  
**Afternoon**: Went to a few different talks. Most of the talks are 15-minute long talks with an extra 5 minutes of questioning (and during these 5 minutes, attendees can move from one room to another). At any given them there must have been ~30 different rooms with talks going on, so it's often hard to decide where to go and tiring to go between places.  
**5pm**: Each evening there is a poster session in a large exhibition room. I went to this session, walked around to visit some of the posters, caught up with a few friends I ran into who were also walking around the hall. Also met with my SEEDS mentee to ask how her day had been going.    
**6.30pm**: Went to dinner with a postdoc from U. Pitt, who wanted to talk about an experiment he is planning to do soon with [duckweed](). He is considering doing an experiment similar to the plant-soil feedback experiments I wrote about in a paper.   
**8pm**: Walked back home with Marcel, who had been practicing his talk at the conference center while I was at dinner. Another UCLA colleague arrived this evening, so now we finally have our full crew of 5 people.  

### Tuesday, 13 August  

This day was a little special because it was the day I gave my talk.  
**6am**: Wake up, run through slides, do some minor tweaks to my slides, practice some tricky phrases that I needed to make sure I got right.  
**7.30am**: Ubered to the conference center. Marcel was speaking in a morning session, so had to make sure we got to the room early, in time for Marcel to load his slides onto the presenting computer.  
**8am**: Talks start at 8 starting now. I kept my schedule light this morning because I was talking in the afternoon. I went to Marcel's talk at 8.20, and several others, but at about 10.30 I stopped going to talks.  
**10.30am**: Visited the "speaker-ready" room, which has a laptop and project identical to all the other setups in the presentation rooms.  I loaded my slides onto the computer and made sure that they look  good, and helped someone else who was having trouble with their slides.  
**11am**: I was scheduled to run the ESA Plant Population Ecology Section's booth in the Poster Hall from 11-1. The idea for this booth is to a) advertise that this section exists, b) encourage people walking by to join the section, and c) sell fundraiser items that members had donated to the section. During my shift very few (3?) people came by, so my job was really easy. I took this time to just take a breath from all the commotion of the past few days and reassure myself that my talk was fine. I also met the person running the Natural History section of ESA, and had a really nice conversation. 
**1.15pm**: Went to my presentation room, loaded my slides onto the presenting computer. The session started at 1.30, and I saw a couple of really nice talks before my own presentation at 2.10. My talk went well -- lots of people in attendance and great questions afterwards, including some that led to more converstaions throughout the week. I saw some other nice talks after my presentation (including a really nice one by my friend [Shan Kothari]()). 
**4.30pm**: Another fun poster session, during which I met more friends and spoke to a few people presenting really interesting science. 
**6pm**: Migrated from the poster session to the Theoretical and Statistical Ecology section's joint mixer. The point of these mixers is just to get together with a community of ecologists (not all statisticians or theoreticians -- everyone welcome), have a drink, and celebrate the winners of the awards that the section gives out (e.g. the Theory section gives out a Best Theory Paper award each year, and the authors of the paper are recognized at the mixer). 
**8pm**: After the mixer, I went out for more drinks with new friends from the mixer. It was fun to celebrate, especially after having finished my talk earlier that day. I probably stayed out later than I should have this evening, but, you know...
