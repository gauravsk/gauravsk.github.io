Hi. Thanks for your interest in my work. Please visit my new website at [https://gauravsk.gitlab.io](https://gauravsk.gitlab.io).

I am in the process of migrating my work away from Github, a company that [maintains](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/letter-from-github-employees-to-ceo-about-the-company-s-ice-contract/fb280de9-2bc3-40d5-b1a5-e3b954bf0d25/) [contracts](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation) with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) despite ICE's systematic and continued cruel treatment of immigrants.
